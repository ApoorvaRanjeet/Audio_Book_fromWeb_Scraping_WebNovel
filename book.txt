Invincible Divine SwordChapter 1: Martial Soul WorldPrev ChapterNext Chapter1 Chapter 1: Martial Soul WorldTranslator: 549690339The sun was just beginning to rise.Behind Yang Family Manor, a child around seven or eight years old was constantly moving about, sometimes as still as a maiden, sometimes as swift as a darting rabbit. As he threw punches, there was actually a strong gust of wind.Yang Xiaotian had been in this world for seven years now and had started practicing the Taiji Scripture since he was four.In his previous life, he was a descendant of the Wudang Sect on Earth. The Taiji Scripture was a profound and secret martial art of the Wudang Sect. Although he had only practiced it for three years now, he already had quite a bit of inner strength in his body.Don’t look at him as just a child; with a single punch, he could send an ordinary adult flying several meters back. Two or three ordinary adults could not get anywhere near him.While Yang Xiaotian was practicing the Taiji Scripture, the sound of footsteps came from the foot of the mountain.Yang Xiaotian didn’t need to look back to know who it was.He stopped practicing and looked over to see a little girl with a long braid, round and large eyes that were both cute and elf-like.Seeing the little girl, Yang Xiaotian showed a smile.The little girl was his younger sister, Yang Ling’er, a year younger than him.As Yang Ling’er climbed up the mountain and saw Yang Xiaotian from afar, she sweetly laughed and said, “Big brother, I knew you sneaked off to the back mountain to play the monkey again.”Play the monkey?Black lines formed on Yang Xiaotian’s forehead as he said, “This isn’t playing the monkey. This is the Wudang Sect’s profound Taiji Scripture.” He had explained this to the little girl countless times already.However, Yang Ling’er stuck out her tongue, with a mischievous grin, and said, “It is playing the monkey.”Yang Xiaotian was speechless; he could never win a verbal argument with this little girl.“What are you looking for me for?” Yang Xiaotian asked his sister, who seemed small but was devilishly clever. Every time she came to the back mountain to find him, it was surely not for anything good.“It’s father and mother who are looking for you,” said Yang Ling’er, twirling her little braid with a mysterious look on her face. “It seems they want to take you into the city for a Martial Soul Awakening.”Martial Soul Awakening!Yang Xiaotian’s heart gave a great thump.Of course, he knew what a Martial Soul Awakening was. In this world, known as the Martial Soul World, when children reached a certain age, they had to undergo Martial Soul Awakening.Only after awakening a Martial Soul could one cultivate.Yang Xiaotian clenched his fists tightly, his emotions stirred. He had long awaited this day. Having been in this world for several years, he had always wanted to know whether he possessed a Martial Soul or what kind of Martial Soul it might be.“Big brother, you better go back quickly. If father and mother can’t find you, they will definitely get angry and spank you,” Yang Ling’er said seriously, tilting her chubby face upward.“Alright, let’s head back quickly,” Yang Xiaotian said with a smile, and tugged on Yang Ling’er’s little braid as they walked down toward Yang Family Manor.Yang Ling’er shouted from behind, “Big brother, if you pull my braid again, I’ll tell mother and father that you were playing the monkey on the back mountain.”The siblings chased and laughed, one after the other.Soon, they returned to Yang Family Manor.When they arrived back at Yang Family Manor, the hall was already filled with quite a number of people. For this Martial Soul Awakening, besides Yang Xiaotian, there was also his uncle’s son, Yang Zhong.Yang Chao saw his son Yang Xiaotian return and snorted, his face stern. However, he did not reprimand Yang Xiaotian in public. He glared at him, thinking, I’ll deal with you when we get back.Yang Xiaotian’s grandfather, the old Manor Lord Yang Ming of Yang Family Manor, saw that everyone had arrived and declared loudly, “Now that everyone is here, let’s set out.”As only the nearby Xingyue City had the Formation for conducting a Martial Soul Awakening, their destination was Xingyue City.Yang Family Manor was not far from Xingyue City, so it took only a little over an hour before everyone arrived at the square in Xingyue City that hosted Martial Soul Awakenings.The square for Martial Soul Awakening was an open space. As long as one paid a certain amount of Gold Coins, they could undergo Martial Soul Awakening.By the time everyone arrived, the square was already packed with people, not only from Yang Family Manor but also disciples from other families in Xingyue City who had come for their Martial Soul Awakening. The scene was bustling.Soon, it was the turn of the Yang Family members.Yang Ming stepped forward, paid the fee for the Martial Soul Awakening, and as a master from Xingyue City infused power into the array, it activated the formation. Suddenly, a hexagonal formation map rose from the ground.“Zhong’er, you go first,” Yang Ming said warmly, beckoning Yang Zhong with a smile.As the eldest grandson of the Yang Family, Yang Ming was very fond of Yang Zhong.“Yes, Grandfather,” Yang Zhong replied. Under everyone’s watchful eyes, he walked to the center of the formation map.Enveloped by the power of the formation map, a radiant light surged around Yang Zhong’s body, and suddenly, a phoenix cry resonating through Heaven and Earth rang out, revealing a giant bird appearing above and behind Yang Zhong.The giant bird was engulfed in flames, its wings stretched wide, spanning ten meters in length, and an astonishing aura spread from it.The crowd on-site was shocked.After the initial surprise, Yang Ming couldn’t help but tremble with excitement, “It’s the Green Phoenix! It’s the level ten Martial Soul, Green Phoenix!”The ranks of Martial Souls go from low to high, from level one to ten, or even beyond with the Supreme Martial Spirit.Supreme Martial Spirits are exceedingly rare, and level ten already signifies supreme talent, so it’s no wonder Yang Ming was so excited.Yang Zhong’s father, Yang Hai, and the high-level experts of the Yang Family who were present were all thrilled.“Congratulations, Manor Lord Yang,” Li Guang, the Li Family Patriarch from Xingyue City, stepped forward with a congratulatory fist and palm salute, smiling, “Yang Family has produced an incredible talent, truly enviable.”Being one of the largest families in Xingyue City, the Li Family was slightly stronger than Yang Family Manor. Hearing Li Guang’s words, Yang Ming laughed heartily and returned the gesture politely, “Thank you, Brother Li. Your care and consideration in the future will be much appreciated.” It was clear to everyone that Yang Ming was feeling proud and excited.The experts from the other families in Xingyue City also came forward to congratulate Yang Ming and Yang Hai.Yang Ming and Yang Hai smiled widely, unable to hide their joy.In the envious gaze of everyone, Yang Zhong walked out from the Formation Map, his brilliance attracting all eyes. Even though he was young, he understood what it meant to have a level ten Martial Soul.From now on, he would be the favorite of Heaven!As he passed by Yang Xiaotian, he looked at him with a hint of pride.Seeing Yang Zhong’s triumphant look, Yang Xiaotian frowned. Though Yang Zhong was his elder uncle’s son, he often targeted him and his younger sister, Yang Ling’er, taking advantage of their grandfather’s doting nature. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐mAlthough it was always Yang Zhong who instigated the conflicts, their grandfather always took Yang Zhong’s side, often leaving him and his sister Yang Ling’er to face the scolding.“Xiaotian, it’s your turn now,” Yang Ming said to Yang Xiaotian.Yang Xiaotian responded and then walked to the center of the formation map.Given that Yang Zhong had a level ten Martial Soul, Xiaotian felt somewhat nervous standing at the center of the formation map.After all, in the Martial Soul World, whether one has a Martial Soul and the level of that Martial Soul would determine a person’s future.The experts from the other families in Xingyue City also watched Yang Xiaotian, curious to find out what Martial Soul the grandson of Yang Ming would awaken.Yang Chao was equally tense, watching his son and silently praying in his heart.In the center of the formation map, wrapped in its power, Yang Xiaotian felt a warm sensation, and soon light began to surge around him.Yang Chao’s heart tightened.Hum!With a faint sound, a phantom flew out from within Yang Xiaotian’s body, looming above and behind his head.Prev ChapterNext ChapterReport

Invincible Divine SwordChapter 2 - 2 Grandpa‚Äôs FavoritismPrev ChapterNext Chapter2 Chapter 2 Grandpa‚Äôs FavoritismTranslator: 549690339What appeared behind Yang Xiaotian was a gigantic black tortoise.The giant tortoise was entwined with a small black snake.The black snake was so small that it was easily overlooked.The moment everyone saw Yang Xiaotian‚Äôs Martial Soul, their faces were full of astonishment.‚ÄúWhat a big tortoise!‚Äù Suddenly, a master from Xingyue City burst out laughing, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs actually a Tortoise Martial Soul, haha, Yang Ming, your grandson‚Äôs Martial Soul is really quite unique.‚ÄùThe crowd soon caught on, and many masters from Xingyue City laughed heartily.Yang Ming looked at the giant tortoise above Yang Xiaotian‚Äôs head, his face turning ugly upon hearing those words.A tortoise?Although the tortoise was not a first-level useless Martial Soul, it was barely better than a useless one, an extremely ineffective second-level Martial Soul.The Tortoise Martial Soul absorbed nature‚Äôs spiritual energy at an incredibly slow pace. With a Tortoise Martial Soul, cultivating for a year could not catch up with others‚Äô ten days of cultivation.Yang Chao, who had been hopeful and praying, turned pale as if he had fallen into an abyss.His son‚Äôs Martial Soul was a tortoise? With a Martial Soul like the tortoise, even if one cultivated madly for a lifetime, it was impossible to become a true Soul Master.At this time, the master from Xingyue City laughed again and said, ‚ÄúIt seems that we have the Tortoise Martial Soul for the first time in Xingyue City? Yang Ming, your grandson has indeed broken the record for our city.‚ÄùUpon hearing this, Yang Ming‚Äôs face grew even uglier.While the surrounding crowd erupted into laughter, Yang Xiaotian stared at his own Martial Soul, lost in thought.His Martial Soul closely resembled the Black Tortoise from the legends of Earth in China.The Black Tortoise was a Supreme Divine Beast.Seeing Yang Xiaotian still standing inside the Formation Map, staring dumbfounded at his own Tortoise Martial Soul, Yang Ming was furious and scolded, ‚ÄúYou shameless thing, get down from there!‚ÄùYang Xiaotian stepped out of the Formation Map, looked at the furious Yang Ming, hesitated for a moment, and explained, ‚ÄúGrandpa, my Martial Soul might not be a tortoise.‚ÄùSeeing Yang Xiaotian still having the audacity to argue, Yang Ming‚Äôs face turned blue with rage, ‚ÄúTake this little thing back home.‚Äù After saying these words, he left in anger, as he had no face to stay any longer.Seeing Yang Ming leave, the masters from Yang Family Manor quickly followed and left Xingyue City.Li Family Patriarch Li Guang saw Yang Ming leaving in a huff and also shook his head. Who would have thought that, among Yang Ming‚Äôs grandsons, one would have a tenth-level Martial Soul, while the other a second-level Martial Soul.Upon returning to Yang Family Manor, the more Yang Ming thought about it, the angrier he became. He said to Yang Chao, ‚ÄúLook at the good son you‚Äôve raised! If he ever dares to leave Yang Family Manor, I will not hesitate to break his legs!‚ÄùToday, Yang Xiaotian had utterly embarrassed him in front of all the masters in Xingyue City.Yang Ming left with a sweep of his sleeves.After Yang Ming had left, Yang Hai smiled at Yang Chao, ‚ÄúSecond brother, don‚Äôt take it too hard. Father is just like that. But I also didn‚Äôt expect Xiaotian‚Äôs Martial Soul to be a tortoise.‚ÄùAnyone could hear the schadenfreude in Yang Hai‚Äôs words.Yang Hai left with his son Yang Zhong and others.Before he left, Yang Zhong said to Yang Xiaotian with a smile, ‚ÄúXiaotian, at the end of the year during the family competition, we must have a good exchange. But you have to practice hard, don‚Äôt get blown away by one punch from me.‚ÄùWatching the departing Yang Hai, Yang Zhong, and others, Yang Chao‚Äôs face turned ugly. He turned to look at his son Yang Xiaotian, opened his mouth to speak but eventually just sighed and said, ‚ÄúXiaotian, it‚Äôs okay. As long as you practice hard, you won‚Äôt lose to Yang Zhong. You can become an Innate Martial Artist.‚ÄùBut was that possible?Yang Chao and Yang Xiaotian returned to their own west courtyard. When Yang Chao and Yang Xiaotian returned, Yang Xiaotian‚Äôs mother Huang Ying came out happily to greet them and asked Yang Chao, ‚ÄúHow did it go? What Martial Soul has Xiaotian awakened?‚ÄùYang Chao‚Äôs face was filled with defeat. Looking at his wife‚Äôs hopeful expression, he eventually shook his head and remained silent.Yang Xiaotian wanted to explain, but in the end he said nothing and returned to his own room. He knew that explanations would be useless now, so he decided to let facts speak for themselves when the time came.The night was pitch-black.Yang Xiaotian sat crossed-legged on the bed in his room, following the Prajna Skill his father had taught him during the day, and activated his Martial Soul.Soon, above his head, a massive shadow of a tortoise appeared.In the eyes of Yang Ming, Yang Zhong, and others, his second-level Martial Soul, Tortoise, which they considered barely better than a useless Martial Soul, opened its huge mouth and started devouring. At once, nature‚Äôs spiritual energy rushed towards Yang Xiaotian like a flood. F√¥ll√¥w ùíèew stories at nùíê/v(e)lb/in(.)comBoom!Yang Xiaotian‚Äôs body shook.The ferocity of nature‚Äôs spiritual energy almost engulfed him.Yang Xiaotian was startled.This is way too intense.Although he suspected that his Martial Soul might be the supreme divine beast, Black Tortoise, the terror of devouring nature‚Äôs spiritual energy far exceeded his imagination.The spiritual energy rushed through the meridians in his body, rapidly transforming into the fighting spirit within him.Under the nourishment of his soul power, his Martial Soul also surged with light, and the little black snake coiled around the Black Tortoise began to grow, opening its mouth to devour nature‚Äôs spiritual energy as well.The little black snake might not seem large, but its speed of devouring nature‚Äôs spiritual energy was no slower than the Black Tortoise‚Äôs.Seeing the little black snake and the Black Tortoise devouring nature‚Äôs spiritual energy at the same time, an odd feeling rose in Yang Xiaotian‚Äôs heart. Could he possess Twin Martial Spirits?And the little black snake‚Äôs rank was not lower than the Black Tortoise‚Äôs!Thinking of this, Yang Xiaotian‚Äôs heart rate quickened. He had been in the Martial Soul World for several years and was somewhat familiar with the situation here. Although Supreme Martial Spirits were rare, he had occasionally heard of them, but he had never heard of anyone in the Martial Soul World with twin Supreme Martial Spirits!Unknowingly, the night passed.When Yang Xiaotian stopped cultivating, dawn had already broken.To his disbelief, after a night of cultivation, he had successfully made a breakthrough to the first rank!His uncle, Yang Hai, with his top-tier eighth-level Martial Soul Earth Bear, had taken three to four months to break through to the first rank.As for his grandfather, Yang Ming, with his ordinary eighth-level Martial Soul, Grey Wolf, it took him a full half year to reach the first rank.Yet now, he had managed it in just one night.To be exact, it took just a few hours.Yang Xiaotian walked into the courtyard and punched a large rock in the corner, immediately leaving a fist imprint several inches deep.All of this was real; he had truly broken through to the first rank! He was now genuinely a first-rank martial artist!Seeing that he had broken through to the first rank in just one night, excitement surged within Yang Xiaotian. If this continued, wouldn‚Äôt he be able to break through the tenth rank and become an Innate Expert in no time?At that moment, arguing voices came from his parents‚Äô room.Yang Xiaotian found it strange, his parents were always affectionate with no history of quarreling. What could they possibly be arguing about? He approached their room.‚ÄúFather is being too unfair,‚Äù his mother Huang Ying‚Äôs sobbing voice rose. ‚ÄúAccording to Yang Family Manor‚Äôs rules, disciples who undergo Martial Soul Awakening are entitled to a portion of Foundation Building Spiritual Liquid. This was a rule set by father, but last night he gave Yang Zhong‚Äôs portion of the Foundation Building Spiritual Liquid to him to consume as well!‚Äù‚ÄúMoreover, you had always been managing the family‚Äôs silk business. Yet, suddenly, father announces that you are no longer to involve yourself in the silk business, instructing elder brother to take charge of both the mines and the silk business. What does this mean?‚Äù‚ÄúYang Hai and Yang Zhong are his son and grandson, but aren‚Äôt you and Xiaotian also his son and grandson?‚Äù‚ÄúFather is too biased!‚ÄùPrev ChapterNext ChapterReport


Invincible Divine SwordChapter 3 - 3 The Sister Gets HitPrev ChapterNext Chapter3 Chapter 3 The Sister Gets HitTranslator: 549690339Yang Xiaotian clenched his fists tightly when he heard this.He couldn’t believe his grandfather could be so blatantly biased.Not only had he given his entire share of Foundation Building Spiritual Liquid to Yang Zhong for cultivation, but he had also handed over the silk business, originally managed by his father, to his eldest uncle.Was it all because he had awakened the Tortoise Martial Soul?Was it because he had humiliated himself in front of everyone in Xingyue City? So much so that even his father had been affected by the anger.Yang Xiaotian returned to his room and continued to cultivate.His grandfather had given his entire share of Foundation Building Spiritual Liquid to Yang Zhong to cultivate, so he would show the people of Yang Family Manor that even without the Spiritual Liquid, he could still be stronger than Yang Zhong.As Yang Xiaotian continued cultivating, in Yang Zhong’s courtyard, Yang Ming watched his grandson with satisfaction. Yang Zhong had not disappointed him. After consuming two portions of Foundation Building Spiritual Liquid last night, the results of his cultivation had exceeded his expectations.The Green Phoenix was truly worthy of its heritage of a Divine Beast’s bloodline.“How do you feel?” Yang Ming asked his grandson Yang Zhong with a loving face.Yang Zhong was filled with confidence, “Grandfather, don’t worry. In one month, before the family’s annual meeting, I will definitely break through and become a first-order martial artist!”One month, one order!Upon hearing this, Yang Ming’s eyes shone brightly, and he laughed loudly, “Good, if you can break through to the first order before the family’s annual meeting, grandfather will reward you generously!”If Yang Zhong could break through to a first-order martial artist in just one month, it would break the records of Xingyue City and create a sensation. He would be more than just the pride of the city.Several days passed in succession.Yang Ming went to Yang Zhong’s courtyard every day to personally instruct him in cultivation. Seeing his grandson make rapid progress each day, Yang Ming was overjoyed.It seemed Yang Zhong wouldn’t even need a month to break through an order.Meanwhile, Yang Xiaotian also stayed indoors, diligently cultivating.One evening, as Yang Xiaotian was absorbing nature’s spiritual energy, a sound like a silkworm breaking free from its cocoon suddenly resounded within him.Yang Xiaotian was overjoyed.After four days of hard cultivation, he had finally made a breakthrough and entered the second order.In the Martial Soul World, even many geniuses with a level-ten Martial Soul would typically need three to four months to achieve a breakthrough to the second order, but he had done it in just four days!Yang Xiaotian couldn’t contain his excitement.Although he didn’t know if anyone in the Martial Soul World had broken through to the second order in four days, he was certain no one in the Divine Sea Country had.When daylight arrived, Yang Xiaotian stopped cultivating, feeling clear-headed and refreshed, as if he had boundless energy.He went out to the yard and began practicing the Taiji Scripture. Each move was executed fluently, as natural as the flowing clouds and water, and as he moved, a current of air swirled around his body.After breaking through to the second order, Yang Xiaotian found that his internal strength had also progressed.But while Yang Xiaotian was practicing the Taiji Scripture, he saw his younger sister Yang Ling’er run in from outside, crying.Yang Xiaotian felt something was amiss and was just about to ask her what happened when he saw a red palm print on her plump little face; her entire left cheek was swollen.Looking at his sister’s swollen left cheek, Yang Xiaotian’s anger surged uncontrollably, “Who did this?”Yang Ling’er cried out but kept shaking her head, refusing to say.Yang Xiaotian saw that the palm print wasn’t very big, it must have been from a child his age, he said angrily, “Was it Yang Zhong who hit you?”Yang Ling’er still shook her head crying, although she didn’t say it, when Yang Xiaotian mentioned Yang Zhong, her expression still changed a bit, Yang Xiaotian’s anger flared: “Let’s go, big brother will go with you to settle the score with him!” Saying this, he pulled his sister up to find Yang Zhong.But as soon as he pulled his sister up, sister Yang Ling’er said it hurt, Yang Xiaotian puzzled, couldn’t help but roll up his sister’s sleeve, to see both arms were covered in shocking whip marks.Although there was no bleeding, it looked painful.Yang Xiaotian’s fury soared to the skies: “Yang Zhong even whipped you with a whip?”Her sister, Yang Ling’er, with tears in her eyes, finally nodded, crying out, “Yang Zhong insulted you as a ‘tortoise’, I couldn’t bear it and called him a name.”What happened next goes without saying.Yang Xiaotian was furious, pulling his sister out of the courtyard to find Yang Zhong. They had only got a short distance from the courtyard when they saw Yang Zhong and several sons of the Yang Family Manor’s stewards, walking along arm in arm, laughing and carrying whips.“Yang Zhong, was it you who hit my sister?” Yang Xiaotian charged up to him.Yang Zhong, seeing Yang Xiaotian coming in a fury, didn’t take it to heart and laughed loudly, “That’s right, it was me who hit her. What about it? You ‘tortoise’ want to stand up for your sister?”No sooner had he finished speaking than Yang Xiaotian charged forward, a slap flying straight to the mark.Yang Xiaotian, who had practiced the Taiji Scripture, was quick and agile, and Yang Zhong couldn’t dodge in time, immediately being struck across the left cheek by Yang Xiaotian’s slap.Smack!A crisp sound echoed, and Yang Zhong staggered wildly, almost falling to the ground.Yang Zhong was dazed by the slap, his ears ringing, tinging with disbelief. Ever since his Martial Soul Awakening, he had been the favored son of the Yang Family Manor, his grandfather doted on him immeasurably, afraid even to let him fall when holding him in hand. Yang Xiaotian actually dared to hit him!A Yang Xiaotian who had awakened a second-grade Martial Soul actually dared to hit him!“You dare to hit me!” Yang Zhong covered his face, yelling angrily, then shouted to the children of the Yang Family Manor standing around, “What are you standing there for, beat him up!”Hearing this, several children of the Yang Family Manor advanced to encircle Yang Xiaotian, but these peers were no match for Yang Xiaotian, who quickly knocked each one to the ground with a single move.Seeing this, Yang Zhong picked up a whip and lashed toward Yang Xiaotian’s face. If the lash connected, it would certainly not be light, but Yang Xiaotian dodged swiftly, grabbed the whip, pulled it away, and then struck back with it.Yang Zhong’s arm was whipped, and the pain made him cry and scream: “Yang Xiaotian, wait until I break through a rank, at the end-of-year clan gathering, I won’t let you off!”The end-of-year clan gathering?At that moment, a flurry of footsteps sounded, clearly Yang Zhong’s crying had alarmed the people of the Yang Family Manor.The first to arrive was Yang Hai, who upon arriving at the scene saw Yang Zhong crying and screaming. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐mSeeing his father coming, Yang Zhong pointed at Yang Xiaotian, crying out, “Father, Yang Xiaotian hit my face.” He then rolled up his sleeve: “He also whipped me.”Yang Hai, seeing his son’s swollen face and the whip marks on his arm, was immediately furiously enraged, and without asking for explanations, berated Yang Xiaotian, “So young, yet you strike with such cruelty. If your parents don’t teach you, then I shall teach you properly!” With that, he raised his hand to slap Yang Xiaotian’s face.“Big brother, stop!” Yang Chao came running, seeing from afar, he cried out in alarm.When Yang Hai saw Yang Chao arriving, he had to stop and was about to angrily question him, but then he saw that his father, Yang Ming, had also arrived.“What happened?” Yang Ming asked from a distance.“Father, it was Xiaotian, he struck Zhong’er’s face and whipped him with a whip,” Yang Hai stepped forward and reported: “Zhong’er’s face is swollen.”“What?!” Yang Ming’s face changed, he stepped forward and saw his grandson Yang Zhong’s face indeed swollen.Prev ChapterNext ChapterReport

Invincible Divine SwordChapter 4 - 4 A Friendly CompetitionPrev ChapterNext Chapter4 Chapter 4 A Friendly CompetitionTranslator: 549690339“You, how could you be so harsh on your own brother!” Yang Ming looked at his grandson Yang Zhong’s face and arms, distressed, and pointed at Yang Xiaotian with both anger and fury in his voice.Yet Yang Xiaotian said, “He hit my sister’s face first and whipped her with a belt!”At that moment, everyone saw the swollen face and the shocking whip marks on both of Yang Ling’er’s tiny arms.On Yang Ling’er’s slender arms, there were at least seven whip marks.But Yang Ming turned a blind eye, pointing at Yang Xiaotian with his beard trembling with rage, “You dare to talk back after hitting your own brother! Servants, lock him up in the ancestral home for one day, and during this day, no one is to bring him food!”No food for a day?Yang Chao’s face changed, “Father!”Now it was deep winter, and the ancestral home was exceedingly cold, growing even colder at night. For a seven-year-old child like Yang Xiaotian to be locked in the ancestral home without food or drink for a day would be extremely hard to endure!“What are you waiting for, lock him up in the ancestral home!” Yang Ming shouted angrily at a manager of the Yang Family Manor.Seeing that manager was about to take her brother away, Yang Ling’er wept and embraced Yang Xiaotian, pleading with Yang Ming, “Grandfather, please don’t lock my brother in the ancestral home, I beg you!”But Yang Ming’s face remained impassive.In the end, Yang Xiaotian was locked up in the ancestral home on the back mountain.With the wooden door of the ancestral home shut, heaven and earth quieted down. Yang Xiaotian, peering through the dim light at the ancestral tablets of many generations of the Yang Family, felt an unexpected sense of calm.No food allowed for one day?He hadn’t expected that after awakening a “Level Two” Tortoise Martial Soul, his grandfather’s disdain for him would go this far.Yang Xiaotian sat down cross-legged, began to practice the Prajna Skill, and focused on thoroughly absorbing nature’s spiritual energy with his Martial Soul.Locked within the ancestral home’s domain, Yang Xiaotian was without distraction, and the speed at which he absorbed nature’s spiritual energy seemed to increase, transforming into spiritual power within his body.By nightfall, cold winds poured into the ancestral home, but Yang Xiaotian felt neither cold nor hungry.In the silent world, his perception continued to expand, even the chirping of insects a hundred meters away could be heard clearly. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐mNot knowing how long had passed, suddenly, the sound of breaking out of a cocoon echoed inside him.Yang Xiaotian was thrilled.He had finally made another breakthrough, stepping into the third rank.Moreover, he discovered that he seemed to have undergone some transformation, his perception far surpassing that of before.Being locked in the ancestral home had turned out to be a blessing in disguise.A day later, Yang Xiaotian was finally released. His father Yang Chao, mother Huang Ying, and sister Yang Ling’er were all waiting outside the ancestral home. As soon as Yang Xiaotian emerged, his mother Huang Ying quietly wiped away tears and hugged Yang Xiaotian tightly.Yang Ling’er was in tears even more, crying her eyes out.“Mother, I’m fine,” Yang Xiaotian said to his mother with a toothy smile, “I even wanted to be locked up for a few more days.” That was actually the truth.In the following days, Yang Xiaotian continued as before, almost never leaving his courtyard to practice.And after that slap, even Yang Zhong became much more subdued, staying in his courtyard and diligently cultivating.Knowing that Yang Zhong was staying in his courtyard, cultivating just like he was and not setting foot outside, Yang Xiaotian had a calm expression. Of course, he knew why Yang Zhong was cultivating so hard.Yang Zhong was only trying to break through to the first tier as soon as possible so that at the family’s year-end gathering, he could teach Yang Xiaotian a lesson.You won’t let me off?Thinking of how Yang Zhong had proclaimed that he wouldn’t let him off at the family’s year-end gathering, Yang Xiaotian suddenly punched out fiercely, releasing spiritual power, and the large stone in the courtyard shattered into countless pieces.Days went by.The end of the year was approaching.The Yang Family Manor began preparations for the New Year, decorating everything in a festive manner.Yang Xiaotian stood in the snow-covered courtyard practicing the Taiji Scripture, with each punch and move, the force of his fists was soft yet resolute, raising swathes of snowflakes from the ground.After breaking through to the third rank, although his speed of breakthrough had slowed, after these days of hard training, Yang Xiaotian had successfully advanced to the fourth rank and reached the peak of the fourth rank.And his Taiji Scripture had made even more obvious progress; his martial strength now covered a range of three meters.After practicing for a while, Yang Xiaotian stopped and felt his body steaming with heat.Tomorrow was the family clan meeting.Originally, the family clan meeting wasn’t supposed to be so soon, but at the earnest request of Yang Zhong, his grandfather Yang Ming had brought the meeting forward.The family clan meeting has been moved up? It seems that Yang Zhong has made a breakthrough to the first tier and can’t wait to teach him a lesson at the clan meeting!Yang Xiaotian strolled out of the yard; he had seldom seen his sister after so many days of intensive training, and he decided to go see the little girl.“Have you heard? Tomorrow at the family clan meeting, a big shot from Divine Sword Academy will come to our Yang Family Manor!”“A big shot from Divine Sword Academy? Who is it? Why is he coming to Yang Family Manor?”The guards of the Yang Family Manor were discussing in the distance.Yang Xiaotian was surprised.Divine Sword Academy? Divine Sword Academy was the foremost academy among the four major academies in Divine Sea Country. If a family disciple could study at Divine Sword Academy, it would bring honor to the entire family.“The big shot from Divine Sword Academy heard that our young master Yang Chao has awakened the Green Phoenix Martial Soul and has made a special trip to the Yang Family Manor to take Yang Chao as his disciple!”“Now the news has spread all over Xingyue City, and many masters have come to offer their congratulations. The old manor lord is grinning so widely he hasn’t closed his mouth.”Several guards were talking animatedly.Yang Xiaotian heard them, but his expression remained unchanged.The next day.The sunshine was somewhat chilly.After Yang Xiaotian got up, he learned that his grandfather Yang Ming, his eldest uncle Yang Hai, and Yang Zhong had gone out early to welcome the VIP from Divine Sword Academy.However, his grandfather didn’t inform his father and him to join in the welcome.In front of the main hall of Yang Family Manor, was the annual venue for the Yang Family clan meeting.When Yang Xiaotian arrived at the main hall with his parents and his younger sister Yang Ling’er, the hall was already crowded with people.There was a buzz of cheerful conversations all around; the arrival of Yang Xiaotian’s family went unnoticed.Yang Xiaotian looked over and saw that his grandfather and the experts from Xingyue City were all clustering around a silver-haired elder.This silver-haired elder was obviously the VIP from Divine Sword Academy.He found out from his father that this person was Chen Yuan, the vice president of Divine Sword Academy.The vice president of Divine Sword Academy was definitely a personage of high rank in Divine Sea Country; even the royal family of Divine Sea wouldn’t dare to slight him, let alone the people of Xingyue City.A while later, the Yang Family Manor’s clan meeting began.Yang Ming said to his grandson Yang Zhong with a face full of affection, “Zhong’er, go up there and show your strength, let Vice President Chen Yuan see the results of your recent cultivation.”Yang Zhong agreed, leapt up, and landed on the Martial Arts Stage in front of the hall. Then he circulated his spiritual energy and released it from within his body.At once, his whole body radiated light.“First tier peak!” Feeling the breath of Yang Zhong, many of the masters from Xingyue City were astonished.It had only been about twenty days since Yang Zhong had awakened his Martial Soul, and he had already broken through to the peak of the first tier.Even Chen Yuan was surprised and could not help but exclaim, “The Green Phoenix is truly a top-tier level 10 Martial Soul.”The Green Phoenix Martial Soul was rare in Divine Sea Country, and that’s exactly why he had made the long journey to Yang Family Manor.This child Yang Zhong had truly given him a pleasant surprise, breaking through to the peak of the first tier in less than twenty days!Such a speed of cultivation he had only seen in a few individuals.Hearing Chen Yuan’s praise, both Yang Ming and Yang Hai’s smiles broadened on their faces.At this point, Yang Zhong’s gaze fell upon Yang Xiaotian in the crowd and he called out, “Xiaotian, I know you have also been diligently cultivating behind closed doors these days.

Invincible Divine SwordChapter 5 - 5 Chen Yuan Takes a DisciplePrev ChapterNext Chapter5 Chapter 5 Chen Yuan Takes a DiscipleTranslator: 549690339Suddenly, all eyes turned toward Yang Xiaotian.Seeing Yang Zhong provocatively looking at him, Yang Xiaotian leaped up and landed on the Martial Arts Stage, ‚ÄúWhy would I be afraid?‚Äù F√¥ll√¥w ùíèew stories at nùíê/v(e)lb/in(.)comChen Yuan, finding Yang Xiaotian interesting, smiled and asked Yang Ming, ‚ÄúWho is this child?‚ÄùYet Yang Ming looked embarrassed and made an awkward noise.Next to him, Li Guang, the Li Family Patriarch of Xingyue City, said to Chen Yuan with a smile, ‚ÄúElder Chen Yuan, this child is Yang Xiaotian, also the grandson of Yang Ming, and he awakened his Martial Soul on the same day as Yang Zhong.‚Äù He paused and then added, ‚ÄúHowever, Yang Xiaotian awakened a second-level Tortoise Martial Soul!‚ÄùSecond-level Tortoise Martial Soul!Li Guang‚Äôs voice was loud, and a wave of laughter spread through the crowd.Chen Yuan was taken aback and shook his head.Yang Ming‚Äôs face turned red with embarrassment, feeling humiliated.Looking at Yang Xiaotian on the Martial Arts Stage, he found him increasingly displeasing to the eye.On the stage, Yang Zhong, seeing that his provocation had worked and Yang Xiaotian had indeed stepped up, laughed, ‚ÄúYang Xiaotian, summon your Martial Soul. I‚Äôve spared you for a few days, and as an elder brother, I‚Äôll let you make the first move.‚ÄùYang Xiaotian, hearing this, did not hold back. However, he did not summon his Martial Soul and instead closed the gap to Yang Zhong with a swift movement, throwing a punch.This punch, without using any inner strength or Fighting Spirit, was fast. Yang Zhong couldn‚Äôt react in time and took the punch squarely.Yang Zhong stumbled backward, clutching his left eye, his face twisted in pain. Pointing at Yang Xiaotian, he exclaimed, ‚ÄúYou!‚Äù But before he could finish, his right eye was struck by another punch from Yang Xiaotian.Yang Zhong stumbled back repeatedly, tears streaming down from the pain.This turn of events stunned everyone present.Seeing Yang Zhong being hit, Yang Ming‚Äôs face hardened with anger, and he scolded, ‚ÄúTo lay such a heavy hand on your own brother, that‚Äôs disgraceful!‚ÄùJust as he finished speaking, Yang Zhong roared and, with a fierce look, unleashed both fists towards Yang Xiaotian‚Äôs heart, attacking with all his might.‚ÄúXiaotian, watch out!‚Äù Yang Chao‚Äôs face changed as he shouted without thinking.Watching Yang Zhong‚Äôs frenzied attack, Yang Xiaotian merely sidestepped lightly, avoiding the assault, and then once again launched a punch. This time, he employed the strength of a first-level warrior‚Äôs Fighting Spirit.Boom!Yang Zhong was sent crashing to the ground.‚ÄúWhat?!‚ÄùThe spectators were all taken aback by what they saw.‚ÄúThis is Fighting Spirit, the power of a first-level warrior!‚Äù Li Guang, the Li Family Patriarch, and many other experts of Xingyue City were shocked as they watched Yang Xiaotian.Wasn‚Äôt Yang Xiaotian a second-level Martial Soul? In less than a month, he had broken through to the first level and become a first-level warrior?Even Chen Yuan from Divine Sword Academy was greatly surprised.A breakthrough to the first level in less than a month, some disciples of Divine Sword Academy might not be able to achieve it, right?At that moment, a figure flashed, rushing onto the Martial Arts Stage. It was Yang Ming, who, looking angrily at Yang Xiaotian, accused, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve reached the first level so quickly, did you secretly eat the family‚Äôs Dragon-Tiger Elixir?‚ÄùSome days ago, he had spent a great deal to purchase a Dragon-Tiger Elixir. Now, seeing Yang Xiaotian‚Äôs sudden breakthrough, he subconsciously thought that Yang Xiaotian had stealthily swallowed the elixir he had obtained. Otherwise, with Yang Xiaotian‚Äôs second-level Martial Soul, how could he possibly have made such a rapid breakthrough?‚ÄúI did not,‚Äù Yang Xiaotian replied when his grandfather questioned him angrily.Hearing this, Yang Ming shouted, ‚ÄúStill trying to argue your way out!‚Äù Then, he ordered the old steward Yang Lin, ‚ÄúQuick, check that Dragon-Tiger Elixir.‚ÄùThe old steward Yang Lin respectfully acknowledged the order and retreated.At this, Yang Hai stepped forward angrily, ‚ÄúHe must have stolen and eaten the Dragon-Tiger Elixir.‚ÄùUpon hearing this, Yang Chao couldn‚Äôt restrain his anger, retorting, ‚ÄúBig brother, which eye of yours saw Xiaotian steal the Dragon-Tiger Elixir?‚ÄùWhile the two argued, old steward Yang Lin returned. He glanced at Yang Xiaotian, approached Yang Ming, and reported, ‚ÄúManor Lord, the Dragon-Tiger Elixir is still intact.‚ÄùYang Ming was stunned.Chen Yuan from Divine Sword Academy suddenly stepped forward, facing Yang Xiaotian, and asked, ‚ÄúChild, can you summon your Martial Soul for me to see?‚ÄùIf Yang Xiaotian hadn‚Äôt consumed the Dragon-Tiger Elixir, then how could he have advanced so rapidly to the first level?He found this strange.Yang Xiaotian hesitated for a moment but eventually summoned his Martial Soul.Suddenly, a giant tortoise appeared before everyone.A wave of snickers and laughter spread across the crowd.Chen Yuan, who had some expectations, was greatly disappointed when he saw Yang Xiaotian‚Äôs Giant Tortoise Martial Soul. Though he didn‚Äôt know how the child had been cultivating, the Martial Soul before him was indeed of the second level.‚ÄúElder Chen Yuan, what do you think?‚Äù Yang Ming asked anxiously.Chen Yuan shook his head and explained to Yang Ming and the others, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a second-level top-tier Black Iron Giant Turtle, and that little Black Snake is the second-level Black Water Snake, parasitic Martial Souls that coexist as one.‚ÄùYang Ming, who had hoped for a miracle, was instantly disheartened upon hearing this.Who was Chen Yuan? The Vice President of Divine Sword Academy, with immense insight. If even he judged it to be a second-level Martial Soul, then it undoubtedly was.Yang Hai, Yang Zhong, and the others were secretly pleased to hear that Yang Xiaotian possessed a second-level parasitic Martial Soul.Yang Xiaotian observed the expressions of Yang Ming, Yang Hai, Yang Zhong, and the rest.Second-level parasitic Martial Soul?Parasitic Martial Soul, he knew, meant that only the main Martial Soul could devour Spiritual Energy from Heaven and Earth, with the other one being utterly useless.Yet both his Martial Souls could devour Spiritual Energy, which alone made it impossible for them to be parasitic.And as for being second-level? That was even less likely.He had broken through four levels within twenty days, how could he possibly have just a second-level Martial Soul?Nevertheless, Yang Xiaotian did not speak out to clarify.Seeing Yang Xiaotian as a second-level Martial Soul and no longer interested, Chen Yuan turned his attention away and asked Yang Zhong to summon his Martial Soul. Instantly, a gigantic bird covered in flames appeared before everyone.‚ÄúIndeed, the Ancient Mythical Beast Green Phoenix!‚Äù Chen Yuan, gazing upon the giant bird, couldn‚Äôt help but admire it before smiling at Yang Zhong, ‚ÄúYang Zhong, would you like to be my disciple?‚ÄùYang Ming and Yang Hai were overjoyed at hearing this.‚ÄúDisciple pays respect to the master,‚Äù Yang Zhong hurriedly bowed, respectfully responding.‚ÄúGood, good!‚Äù Chen Yuan laughed heartily, content that his long journey to the Yang Family Manor wasn‚Äôt in vain, now that he could take a tenth-level top-tier Martial Soul disciple under his wing.Prev ChapterNext ChapterReport

Invincible Divine SwordChapter 6: The Hijacking of Mineral MaterialsPrev ChapterNext Chapter6 Chapter 6: The Hijacking of Mineral MaterialsTranslator: 549690339The people of Xingyue City, upon seeing Chen Yuan take Yang Zhong as his disciple, gathered around and congratulated Chen Yuan, Yang Ming, and Yang Hai.Amidst the packed Martial Arts Stage, Yang Xiaotian and his father withdrew from the stage.Nobody paid attention to their departure.Half a day later, the annual meeting ended.In his room, Yang Zhong, rubbing his still somewhat sore eyes, thought of the day’s events and grew increasingly resentful, “Yang Xiaotian, once I return from Divine Sword Academy during the summer break, I definitely won’t let you off!”Tomorrow, Chen Yuan would take him to Divine Sword Academy for cultivation, with both Divine Sword Academy’s and Chen Yuan’s training, he would soon break through to the second, third, or even fourth tier!When he returned to Yang Family Manor in half a year, he would settle the score with Yang Xiaotian.The next day.The snow had stopped.Under the joyful and respectful send-off of everyone at Yang Family Manor, Chen Yuan set off with Yang Zhong, leaving the Yang Family Manor behind.Before leaving, Yang Zhong harshly said to Yang Xiaotian, “When I come back during the summer break, I will challenge you to a duel.”Yang Xiaotian, looking at the fiercely resentful Yang Zhong, replied, “Then I’ll wait for you. Don’t end up getting beaten by a single move and crying again.”Chen Yuan, who heard this from the side, shook his head and chuckled, considering Yang Xiaotian’s words as mere childish ignorance.With his and Divine Sword Academy’s training, his disciple Yang Zhong would undoubtedly break through to the fourth tier in half a year. How could Yang Xiaotian, with his Giant Tortoise Martial Soul, possibly be a match for his disciple?In half a year, Yang Xiaotian would certainly not be able to withstand a single move from his disciple.Eventually, Yang Zhong and Chen Yuan disappeared from the view of the people of the Yang family.Yang Xiaotian’s life returned to its previous tranquility.As before, he cultivated without stepping out of his home.Sitting cross-legged on the bed in his room, Yang Xiaotian circulated the Prajna Skill, and soon, the Black Tortoise Divine Beast Martial Soul appeared once again.After days of cultivation, both the Black Tortoise Divine Beast Martial Soul and the Black Snake Martial Spirit had undergone some changes. The Black Snake’s body had become shinier and grew some scales, while on the massive shell of the Black Tortoise, faint patterns had emerged.These patterns were extremely profound.As the Black Tortoise Divine Beast and Black Snake devoured the nature’s spiritual energy, it continuously transformed into Fighting Spirit within Yang Xiaotian’s body.Boom!A faint, clear sound rang inside his body.Yang Xiaotian, who was already at the peak of the fourth tier, finally made another breakthrough and stepped into the fifth tier.Upon breaking into the fifth tier, another line of patterns appeared on the shell of the Giant Tortoise, and the patterns grew deeper, no longer faintly visible as before.As for the Black Snake, its scales became even darker and shinier, and it had grown significantly larger.By the time daylight came, Yang Xiaotian stopped the Martial Soul cultivation and started practicing the Taiji Scripture in the courtyard.The Taiji Scripture was a profound inner strength cultivation technique, which complemented Fighting Spirit and also strengthened the body. He persistently practiced it every day.Several more days passed.The end of the year was approaching. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐mThe snowfall grew even heavier.This year’s snow was heavier than in previous years.Yang Xiaotian, looking at the drifting snowflakes, furrowed his brows tightly.These past few days, rumors had been swirling around Yang Family Manor, saying that he was able to break through a tier so quickly because his father, while previously managing the family’s silk business, had embezzled from the family’s funds and used them to buy Spirit Pills for his cultivation.Spirit Pills were far superior to Foundation Building Spiritual Liquid, but they came with a hefty price tag.With these rumors spreading, the face of his grandfather was becoming increasingly unsightly.Although his father and mother had explained many times, his grandfather simply did not believe them.“`These rumors and slanders must have been the work of his uncle Yang Hai.Thinking of his parents’ worried and sighing demeanors these days, Yang Xiaotian clenched his fists tightly.As Yang Xiaotian was lost in thought, he saw his younger sister Yang Ling’er bouncing in excitedly, “Brother, father and mother asked me to call you over.”“Call me for what?” Yang Xiaotian asked with a smile, seeing the girl’s happy demeanor.“The New Year is just a few days away, father and mother bought us new clothes, they want you to come and try them on,” the little girl said laughingly, then she lowered her voice, “I’ll tell you a secret, there’s lots of yummy treats, there are pastries from Rice Flower Village, nuts from Huaguo Mountain, and taffy.”Whether it was the pastries from Rice Flower Village or the nuts from Huaguo Mountain, both were the siblings’ favorites.Seeing the little girl drooling, Yang Xiaotian laughed.The siblings chattered and laughed their way to the front hall.Huang Ying, seeing the siblings entering, smiled warmly at both. She beckoned Yang Xiaotian over and said with a smile, “Xiaotian, come here, your mother bought you new clothes, try them on to see if they fit.”Yang Xiaotian approached his mother and put on the New Year’s clothes she had bought for him.The new clothes were lined with cotton, very warm and comfortable.Huang Ying looked at her son Yang Xiaotian, her emotions mixed. She had seen how hard her son had been practicing these days, and she felt both heartache and pride.As parents, of course, she hoped her son would achieve great things in the future.Yet, thinking of her son’s Martial Soul, she sighed inwardly.In the Martial Soul World, there has never been a second-level Martial Soul that became an Innate Expert.“Mother, where’s father?” asked Yang Xiaotian.“Your father has been called over by your grandfather,” replied Huang Ying with a smile, “he said he has something for your father to do.”Something for father to do?Yang Xiaotian was puzzled.Ever since he awakened the Giant Tortoise Martial Soul, his grandfather had been extremely cold towards his father, not allowing him to meddle in any affairs of the Yang Family Manor. And now he was being tasked with a job?This was very abnormal.Just then, Yang Xiaotian saw his father return with a somber face.“Chao, what did father ask you to do?” Huang Ying also noticed the change in Yang Chao’s expression and went up to ask.“A few days ago, the minerals my elder brother was escorting to Heavenly Sword Manor got robbed by Black Wind Stronghold,” Yang Chao said gravely, “Elder brother and father have asked me to go to Black Wind Stronghold and retrieve them.”“What?!” Huang Ying was infuriated, “The minerals were lost by your elder brother, but father isn’t asking him to retrieve them, instead he sends you. Black Wind Stronghold is filled with murderous bandits, isn’t this like sending you to your death?!”Yang Xiaotian also felt his blood boil.“Did you agree to it?” Huang Ying pressed Yang Chao further.Yang Chao remained silent.Seeing her husband’s expression, Huang Ying knew the answer, and she burst into tears, “If something really happens to you, what will Xiaotian, Ling’er, and I do as widows and orphans?”“I’ll go find father!”As Huang Ying was about to go and find her father-in-law, Yang Chao exclaimed, “Stop!” He then said, “Father mentioned that I should take ten thousand gold to Black Wind Stronghold to ransom the minerals. The minerals aren’t much use in the hands of Black Wind Stronghold; they should agree to the trade.”“Furthermore, father said if I can retrieve the minerals and deliver them to Heavenly Sword Manor on time, he will let me manage the mines together with elder brother.”Still teary-eyed, Huang Ying said, “But what if Black Wind Stronghold doesn’t agree? If they know you have ten thousand gold, they might kill you and everyone from Yang Family Manor who goes with you!”Yang Chao hesitated, then replied, “The leader of Black Wind Stronghold is an Innate Expert of the fourth level, same as me; he can’t harm me. Don’t worry, if we see the situation turn sour, we’ll fight our way out. There won’t be any problems.”But was it really so?Black Wind Stronghold was home to more than one Innate Expert. Although their leader was of the fourth Innate level, the stronghold itself had fourteen Innate Experts! And Black Wind Stronghold boasted four to five hundred people.If you compared the overall strength, Yang Family Manor was weaker than Black Wind Stronghold.Moreover, for this trip, Yang Chao could only take twenty people; if negotiations broke down, it was uncertain whether they could fight their way out of Black Wind Stronghold.“`Prev ChapterNext ChapterReport

Invincible Divine SwordChapter 7 - 7 Twin Supreme Martial SpiritsPrev ChapterNext Chapter7 Chapter 7 Twin Supreme Martial SpiritsTranslator: 549690339Yang Xiaotian returned to his room with the New Year clothes his mother had bought for him.Looking at the Rice Flower Village pastries his mother had stuffed into his hands, Yang Xiaotian found them hard to swallow.Because after the New Year, his father would have to go to Black Wind Stronghold.‚ÄúInnate realm fourth level, fourteen Innates,‚Äù Yang Xiaotian muttered to himself.He had already learned from his parents about the general situation of Black Wind Stronghold; only by making a breakthrough to the Innate realm could he be of any help to his father.But now, with less than ten days left until the New Year, even if his cultivation speed was fast, even if he possessed two Supreme Martial Spirits, it was impossible for him to cultivate to the Innate level.Yang Xiaotian‚Äôs eyebrows were tightly knit, and in his restlessness, he went to the mountain behind his home to practice the Taiji Scripture, executing each move gracefully and eventually entering a state of self-forgetfulness.Just as Yang Xiaotian was practicing the Taiji Scripture, suddenly, something hit his forehead.Yang Xiaotian couldn‚Äôt help but stop and hold his throbbing forehead; looking up, he saw a golden Golden Armored Beast in the distance, which had appeared at some point.The Golden Armored Beast, resembling Earth‚Äôs pangolin with its body covered in golden scales, was not strong in attack but had strong defense and was quick and agile.With a pinecone in its hand, the Golden Armored Beast, having hit Yang Xiaotian, covered its mouth and giggled, infuriating Yang Xiaotian.‚ÄúWhite Crane Spreads Wings!‚Äù Yang Xiaotian charged forward, throwing a punch with his Taiji Fist.But the nimble little guy dodged Yang Xiaotian‚Äôs attack and stood about ten meters away, shaking its rear at him.Yang Xiaotian, infuriated, chased after it again. Although his Fighting Spirit and inner strength were not weak, he still failed to catch it.In this way, man and beast chased one another, unwittingly entering deep into the mountains.At last, the Golden Armored Beast arrived at an inconspicuous mountain, slipped through the wild grass, and disappeared in the blink of an eye. After hesitating for a moment, Yang Xiaotian also went through the wild grass and found a small cave behind it.This small cave was very hidden, completely invisible from outside.Looking at the dark small cave in front of him, he hesitated for a moment, then walked in.The cave was deeper than he had imagined; he walked for a while and still did not see the end. The cave was dimly lit, and Yang Xiaotian could only vaguely see a few meters ahead.After about a hundred or two hundred meters, just as Yang Xiaotian was thinking about turning back, he saw the Golden Armored Beast emerge from somewhere and beckon to him.Yang Xiaotian hesitated for a brief moment, then followed.After a while, the cave branched off into many pathways.The Golden Armored Beast led Yang Xiaotian through the maze-like cave, moving continuously forward.After passing through over a dozen forks, light appeared ahead. Seeing this, Yang Xiaotian hurried forward and upon reaching the light, was stunned by what he saw. Aall ùíèùíÜwest chùíÇptùíÜrs on n.o./vùíÜlùíÉi/n/(.)cùíêmHe found himself halfway up a mountain, facing a small mountain valley that was filled with the chirping of birds and fragrant flowers, a veritable paradise.At that moment, the Golden Armored Beast was at the bottom of the small valley, gesturing to Yang Xiaotian.Yang Xiaotian gritted his teeth, gathered his inner strength, and leaped downward to the valley floor. He landed on a tree branch and used the recoil to jump onto another branch. After several such moves, he finally landed at the bottom of the valley.The valley was very spacious, probably spanning several thousand square meters, filled with various fruit trees, and covered with various flowers and medicinal herbs, exuding pleasant fragrances.Yang Xiaotian was overjoyed.At this time, the Golden Armored Beast climbed a fruit tree, took a bite of a fruit, and then plucked another one and tossed it to Yang Xiaotian. Catching it, Yang Xiaotian bit into the lush, dripping fruit, delighting in the sweetness and the warm flow of juice that brought an overwhelming sense of comfort through his body!After eating one fruit, Yang Xiaotian quickly sat down cross-legged and started to circulate his Prajna Skill.Several hours later, he had finally refined the power of the Spirit Fruit, discovering that both his internal strength and Fighting Spirit had greatly advanced, equivalent to several days of rigorous training.This pleasant surprise exceeded Yang Xiaotian‚Äôs expectations.With these fruits, it was possible he could break through to the Innate level before the new year.Although the hope was still slim, at least there was a glimmer of hope.Just as Yang Xiaotian was about to continue consuming the fruits to cultivate, he saw the Golden Armored Beast point towards something in front of them.Yang Xiaotian looked and saw an opening in the cliff face ahead; this opening was different from the previous one and seemed to have been lived in by someone.After a moment of thought, Yang Xiaotian leaped to the entrance and walked in, while the Golden Armored Beast stood outside the entrance with a face full of dread, as if there was something terrifying inside the cave.Seeing the Golden Armored Beast‚Äôs expression, Yang Xiaotian felt a surge of suspicion in his heart. He carefully advanced into the cave and, after crossing a small path several meters long, arrived at a large hall of dozens of square meters with four rooms on the side.Four fist-sized night pearls were embedded in the four walls of the hall, illuminating the entire space as if it were daylight.Yang Xiaotian was astonished; he hadn‚Äôt expected this humble cave to contain a heaven within a hole. After making sure there was no danger, he went into the first room.The first room contained nothing but a Cold Jade Bed.When Yang Xiaotian entered the second room, he saw a stone table, with two books placed upon it, and an Ancient Sword stuck next to it.Yang Xiaotian flipped through one of the books and saw it was titled ‚ÄúPrimordial Dragon Art.‚Äù As he read further, his excitement grew; according to the book, the Primordial Dragon Art was the most top-level Cultivation Technique of the Ancient Dragon Clan.After practicing it, one would not only possess a powerful body like the Ancient Dragon Clan but also wield the True Dragon Power.Although Yang Xiaotian did not know the exact level of this Cultivation Technique, since the Dragon Clan was among the highest tier of Divine Beasts in Heaven and Earth, the Primordial Dragon Art, as the top-level technique of the Ancient Dragon Clan, must be incredibly potent.Having finished flipping through the book, Yang Xiaotian struggled to calm his excitement. The book claimed that the Primordial Dragon Art was extremely domineering and required a Beast Martial Soul of the same level as the Ancient Dragon Clan in order to cultivate it.He possessed the Black Tortoise Divine Beast Martial Soul, which was perfectly suited to cultivate the Primordial Dragon Art.After calming himself down, Yang Xiaotian opened the second book.The second book was a Swordsmanship manual titled ‚ÄúHeaven-Penetrating Sword Technique.‚ÄùThis Heaven-Penetrating Sword Technique was the prestigious secret art of the Heaven-Penetrating Divine Sect, a superpower in the Martial Soul World.And the sword was one of the top ten Divine Swords of the Martial Soul World, the Heaven-Penetrating Divine Sword.After looking through the book, Yang Xiaotian‚Äôs heart raced.There was a piece of paper filled with writing inside the book, a note left by Hong Feng, the previous Sect Hierarch of the Heaven-Penetrating Divine Sect.This cave was where he secluded himself for cultivation years ago.According to him, the entrance of the cave was protected by a Formation he had set up; only a person with a Supreme Martial Spirit could enter and inherit the Heaven-Penetrating Sword Technique and Primordial Dragon Art, thus becoming his successor.‚ÄúSupreme Martial Spirit?‚Äù Yang Xiaotian mused to himself.Martial Spirits from level eleven to thirteen were considered Super Martial Spirits, while a fourteenth-level Martial Spirit was known as a Supreme Martial Spirit.Now that he was able to enter the cave,This meant his Martial Soul was at least level fourteen!It might even be a dual level fourteen Martial Soul.Prev ChapterNext ChapterReport

Invincible Divine SwordChapter 8: UnmatchedPrev ChapterNext Chapter8 Chapter 8: UnmatchedTranslator: 549690339“`Upon learning that he might be the owner of a Dual Supreme Martial Spirit, Yang Xiaotian could barely contain his excitement.If he truly possessed a Dual Supreme Martial Spirit, then wouldn’t he be capable of attaining godhood, or even surpassing it!“He who masters my Heaven-Penetrating Sword Technique will be my successor, Hong Feng’s chosen heir. Strive hard in your practice, fully cultivate the Heaven-Penetrating Sword Technique, and take charge of my Heaven-Penetrating Divine Sect!”“I, Hong Feng, once wielded the Heaven-Penetrating Divine Sword, sweeping across the Martial Soul World undefeated!”“May you live up to my esteemed name,”Hong Feng said in the message.After reading this, Yang Xiaotian’s heart was profoundly shaken.Sweeping across the Martial Soul World undefeated!How powerful must Hong Feng have been!The might of the Heaven-Penetrating Divine Sword seemed to far exceed his imagination.Following the method described by Hong Feng, he cut his finger and let a drop of blood fall onto the Heaven-Penetrating Divine Sword, then recited the incantation silently. Immediately, he felt a flesh-and-blood connection with the sword.When he drew the Heaven-Penetrating Divine Sword, a terrifying Sword Qi soared into the sky, instantly altering the color of heaven and earth.The Nine Heavens were blasted open with a massive hole.The entirety of Xingyue City, as well as the whole Divine Sea Country, felt this frightening Sword Qi.Yang Xiaotian was taken aback.Fortunately, in the blink of an eye, the Sword Qi from the Heaven-Penetrating Divine Sword disappeared as if it were an illusion.Only then did Yang Xiaotian breathe a sigh of relief.He silently recited the sword incantation, and the Heaven-Penetrating Divine Sword immediately turned into a beam of light that merged into his right forearm, where an image of the Divine Sword appeared as a tattoo.From now on, as he cultivated the Heaven-Penetrating Sword Technique, the Heaven-Penetrating Divine Sword would completely integrate into his body. Then, even without summoning the sword, he could unleash myriad Sword Qi.After securing the Primordial Dragon Art, he moved on to the third room.The third room was filled with various Cultivation Technique Manuals. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)comThese were all collected by Hong Feng during his travels across the world.However, Yang Xiaotian already had the Primordial Dragon Art, and although the other techniques were good, they were of no use to him.To Yang Xiaotian’s surprise, the fourth room contained a Medicine Cauldron. There was a line of text left by Hong Feng on it, which he approached to read.It turned out that this Medicine Cauldron, acquired by Hong Feng from a dangerous place in the Martial Soul World, was so unique that even he did not know its name. It could change in size, and had multiple compartments within, suitable for storing medicinal herbs and other items.Yang Xiaotian was delighted. This unnamed Medicine Cauldron was like an ultimate travel bag. With it, his future travels would be much more convenient.Doing as Hong Feng instructed, he dripped blood to refine the Medicine Cauldron and, with a thought, it shrank continuously until it became a ring that he wore on the ring finger of his left hand, indistinguishable from an ordinary ring to the uninformed.Subsequently, Yang Xiaotian looked at the walls, which were covered with bookshelves filled with various Secret Tomes.He stepped forward to browse, and they were all Alchemy Secret Manuals.Becoming an Alchemist was an extremely noble profession in the Martial Soul World.Much more prestigious than martial artists.However, becoming an Alchemist required extremely stringent conditions: one must not only be intimately familiar with various medicinal herbs but also be able to control Heaven and Earth Fire and have an exceptionally strong spiritual sensitivity.Every single condition was indispensable.This was why Alchemists were so rare in the Martial Soul World. Even the Yang Family Manor could not cultivate an Alchemist over many years.In the whole Xingyue City, only the City Lord’s Mansion had an Alchemist, and that was just a one-star.Still, they were esteemed as honored guests by the City Lord’s Mansion.“I wonder if there is a method here for concocting Foundation Building Spiritual Liquid,” Yang Xiaotian thought to himself.After some searching, at the bottom of a bookshelf, he did indeed find the method to concoct Foundation Building Spiritual Liquid.Looking at the detailed introduction on concocting Foundation Building Spiritual Liquid, Yang Xiaotian’s heart raced.If he could concoct the Foundation Building Spiritual Liquid, combined with the fruits outside for cultivation, his power would undoubtedly advance even faster, and he would have an eighty to ninety percent certainty of breaking through to the Innate Realm before the new year.He read carefully, then located the fourteen kinds of medicinal materials required for concocting Foundation Building Spiritual Liquid in the valley’s medicinal garden, and placed them one by one into the Medicine Cauldron.Next, following the method described in the book, Yang Xiaotian began to sense the surrounding Heaven and Earth Fire.This step was the most difficult, as due to individual differences in souls, the vast majority of people were unable to sense the Heaven and Earth Fire.“`“`However, it didn’t take long for Yang Xiaotian to sense the Heaven and Earth Fire stirring all around him.This Heaven and Earth Fire was abundant in the vicinity, resembling a sea of fire, boundless and endless.The previously tense and uneasy Yang Xiaotian was stunned.This is the Heaven and Earth Fire?!But wasn’t it said in the books that many alchemists could sense the presence of Heaven and Earth Fire within only a few meters around them the first time?Now, the range he could sense was surely over a hundred meters!He couldn’t believe it, and as he tried to draw the fire with his spiritual power, instantly, the Heaven and Earth Fire converged into a stream, merging into the medicine cauldron.In alchemy, the heat mustn’t be too strong, or the herbs would instantly turn to ashes, nor too weak, for if it’s too gentle, the herbs won’t melt properly.As Yang Xiaotian nervously controlled the Heaven and Earth Fire, the fourteen types of herbs began to melt one by one through calcination, eventually forming a small, lively tuft of cyan liquid.Staring at the cyan liquid in the cauldron, Yang Xiaotian was dumbfounded.The Foundation Building Spiritual Liquid, just like that, it was refined?It seemed, not that difficult, huh.For the Pharmacist Hall to assess a one-star alchemist, one only needed to successfully concoct a batch of Foundation Building Spiritual Liquid within three hours.He had taken less than an hour.Doesn’t that mean he already qualifies as an alchemist?Yang Xiaotian still couldn’t believe the content of the cauldron was Foundation Building Spiritual Liquid.After hesitating for a moment, he swallowed it.Instantly, a warm current surged through his body.He attempted to circulate the Primordial Dragon Art.The Black Tortoise and Black Snake Martial Spirit appeared, and above the vast sky, an endless stream of nature’s spiritual energy cascaded down at a speed many times faster than when he previously cultivated the Prajna Skill.The medicinal power of the Foundation Building Spiritual Liquid was continuously transformed into Fighting Spirit within his meridians.Soon, the Foundation Building Spiritual Liquid was completely refined.When Yang Xiaotian ceased cultivating, he found that he had reached the late phase of the fifth rank within the Acquired Realm.He was both shocked and delighted.The Foundation Building Spiritual Liquid he had concocted was certainly genuine, and it was definitely not of ordinary quality, otherwise, it wouldn’t have had such an effective medicinal power.The same elixir, with different qualities, naturally yielded different effects, ranging from low to high: inferior, low, medium, high, superior, with top grade above superior.The batch of Foundation Building Spiritual Liquid he just made was most likely high grade, or possibly even superior.Yang Xiaotian looked at the herbs in the valley, his emotions surging. With these herbs, he could continuously concoct Foundation Building Spiritual Liquid, and there was hope of breaking through to the Innate Realm before the New Year.When Yang Xiaotian emerged from the cave, he found that it had grown completely dark, which scared him into hurrying back to the Yang Family Manor. Indeed, upon returning to the Yang Family Manor, his parents had been sending people out to look for him for a while.In the end, Yang Xiaotian received a spank with a stick.However, late at night after everyone in the Yang Family Manor had gone to bed, he snuck back to the valley to continue refining the Foundation Building Spiritual Liquid and cultivating.Thus, during the day Yang Xiaotian would practice the Heaven-Penetrating Sword Technique back at the Yang Family Manor, and at night, he would cultivate in the valley. Occasionally, he would venture deep into the mountains with the Golden Armored Beast to hunt fierce beasts, enhancing his combat experience.After four days in a row, Yang Xiaotian made rapid progress, breaking through to the peak of the tenth rank.He was only one step away from the Innate Realm.In the courtyard of the Yang Family Manor, the swordplay was spirited. Yang Xiaotian thrust his sword, and a sword hole appeared instantly on a stake ten meters away.Seeing the sword hole that was several inches deep, he nodded in satisfaction.The Heaven-Penetrating Sword Technique, true to its reputation as one of the top ten sword techniques in the world. Although he was only in the Acquired tenth rank, the power of that single thrust was such that many martial artists at the first level of the Innate Realm would struggle to withstand it.And that was only the weakest first move of the Heaven-Penetrating Sword Technique.The Heaven-Penetrating Sword Technique had a total of forty-nine moves, with the power increasingly formidable as one progresses further.Afterwards, Yang Xiaotian pondered over the Innate Realm but was troubled, as after breaking through to the tenth rank, the Foundation Building Spiritual Liquid’s effect had greatly diminished. At the current rate, even if he kept persistently cultivating with the Foundation Building Spiritual Liquid, it would take at least six to seven days to break through to the Innate Realm.But the New Year was just around the corner, and his father was about to set off for the Black Wind Stronghold.He couldn’t wait that long.What should he do?“`Prev ChapterNext ChapterReport

Invincible Divine SwordChapter 9 - 9 It was me who found it firstPrev ChapterNext Chapter9 Chapter 9 It was me who found it firstTranslator: 549690339“To break through to the Innate level before the New Year, one would need an Innate Spirit Pill!”But he was still unable to refine an Innate Spirit Pill.Because only an Innate Expert could refine it.Where could he find an Innate Spirit Pill?Moreover, an Innate Spirit Pill would cost at least ten thousand gold.He didn’t have that much money to buy one.Besides, Innate Spirit Pills were rare; they weren’t sold in Xingyue City or the surrounding cities at all.What a headache!However, just as Yang Xiaotian was about to slip out of the Yang Family Manor, he noticed that the number of patrolling guards had doubled compared to usual, which he found odd.After overhearing the guards’ conversation, Yang Xiaotian learned that a fugitive wanted by the Imperial Court had made his way to Xingyue City.This man was named Hu Lie, cruel and ruthless, who had slaughtered a household of dozens; moreover, while fleeing, he had killed several patrolmen and an Alchemist.The man was not weak, a second-layer Innate expert.No wonder Yang Family Manor was so well-guarded.Nevertheless, Yang Xiaotian didn’t pay much attention to it.If he really encountered Hu Lie, he actually wanted to use him to test his current strength.After leaving Yang Family Manor, Yang Xiaotian took his usual route towards the valley.However, not long after entering the dense forest, Yang Xiaotian suddenly saw a man leaning against a large tree in the distance. He instantly realized something was off and looked closely, only to see that the man had a face full of beard, his robe was somewhat tattered, and it was stained with lots of blood.Just then, Hu Lie also realized someone was there and abruptly stood up, turning his head towards Yang Xiaotian. Instantly, a ferocious aura rushed towards him.However, when he saw that Yang Xiaotian was just a child of seven or eight years old, he was taken aback. But then, with a murderous look in his eyes, he lifted his heavy blade and walked towards Yang Xiaotian, “Kid, it’s just your bad luck to run into me.”“Don’t worry, it’s just one slice, it’ll be quick, and you won’t feel any pain!”Hu Lie’s blade was indeed swift.In the space of a breath, the blade had already reached in front of Yang Xiaotian’s neck. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐mJust when Hu Lie was sure that the blade would chop off the head of the child before him, suddenly, the figure in front of him flashed, and his blade missed its target.Immediately after, a powerful force of a fist exploded from beneath his ribs.Hu Lie had no time to dodge and was struck in the ribs by a fist.Bang!The sound of breaking bones resounded.He was sent flying several meters back.Stabilizing himself, Hu Lie felt the pain at his ribs and looked in disbelief at the child in front of him: “Tenth-order late-stage peak?”This child was actually an Acquired peak master!He had traveled all over the place, been to more than a dozen kingdoms, and seen many talents, but this was the first time he had encountered a seven or eight-year-old late-stage peak master.This is Xingyue City of Divine Sea Country, isn’t it? Divine Sea Country has produced such a monstrous talent?“May I know which family this young brother belongs to?” Hu Lie’s thoughts raced, and he pretended to smile amicably, “I mean no harm. I am here to visit relatives and by chance was robbed on the way here. I thought you were one of the robbers coming after me.”While speaking, Hu Lie gradually moved closer to Yang Xiaotian without a trace.Seeing through the other’s intentions, Yang Xiaotian was well aware. So, when Hu Lie suddenly burst forward to strike him again, the Heaven-Penetrating Sword appeared in Yang Xiaotian’s hand, and he thrust it out instantly.A speck of sword light pierced the darkness.Under the moonlight, the sword light was dazzlingly brilliant.Hu Lie felt a pain in his left eye and couldn’t help but cover it and scream. Yang Xiaotian’s sword had just blinded his left eye.“Sword Qi, how can you, an Acquired, have Sword Qi!” In the midst of his pain, Hu Lie looked at Yang Xiaotian in both shock and anger.Only an Innate Grandmaster could wield Sword Qi, yet Yang Xiaotian was clearly just an Acquired peak expert.“Who told you that an Acquired can’t use Sword Qi?” Seeing his sword strike a success, Yang Xiaotian felt a weight lift from his heart.“You little thing, so what if you can wield Sword Qi,” Hu Lie roared in fury, “Today, you will die!” With that, a massive tiger Martial Soul appeared behind him.Then, tiger-striped patterns emerged all over his body, and his hands transformed into sharp claws, much like those of a tiger.This was the Transformation.Upon awakening one’s Martial Soul, different Martial Souls possess different abilities. After Hu Lie’s Transformation, he gained the speed and strength of a ferocious tiger.Hu Lie lunged at Yang Xiaotian once more.Under the moonlight, his claws glistened with a chilling radiance.Hu Lie’s speed had increased by half from before.Transformation, huh?Seeing the opponent charging at him, Yang Xiaotian remained calm, his body surged with radiance, and patterns like those of the Black Tortoise’s shell emerged on his skin.At the same time, a dark glow continuously emanated from his body, completely merging him with the darkness.If Hu Lie could undergo Transformation, he could do it as well.Moreover, he possessed Twin Martial Spirits, which allowed him to undergo Dual Transformation.Yang Xiaotian thrust his sword out once again.This time, he executed the first technique of the Heaven-Penetrating Sword Technique.A flash of the sword so fast Hu Lie was utterly unable to track it.After his Transformation, Yang Xiaotian was as swift as a ghost, blending into the darkness, making it extremely difficult for the naked eye to perceive him.Hu Lie, who had just reached Yang Xiaotian, felt a pain in his throat and froze in place, his eyes filled with shock, his expression incredulous as if he had witnessed something unbelievable.“Dual Transformation, Twin Martial Spirits?” Hu Lie struggled to open his mouth as he fell, his throat’s blood ceaselessly staining the ground red.Yang Xiaotian looked at the lifeless Hu Lie and let out a sigh of relief.Simultaneously, he was inwardly elated. Under the Dual Transformation, combined with the Heaven-Penetrating Sword Technique, the power was beyond his imagination.Seeing the bundle Hu Lie had dropped in the distance, something sparked in Yang Xiaotian’s mind. He went over, opened it and found a martial arts Secret Tome, the “Soul Severing Blade Technique.”Besides this martial arts tome, there were some gold pieces, a book of Alchemy insights, and a jade bottle.When Yang Xiaotian opened the jade bottle, the fragrance of the Elixir hit his nostrils, instantly invigorating his spirit.This is!He tipped his palm and saw two pills, crystal clear and emanating waves of Elixir fragrance, land in his hand.These past few days, Yang Xiaotian had been flipping through Alchemy books in the valley cave, gaining a fair understanding of Elixirs. Seeing these two pills, he was tremendously pleased.“Four Symbols Spirit Pill.”The Four Symbols Spirit Pill, like the Dragon-Tiger Elixir that his grandfather had once purchased at a high price, was an Innate Spirit Pill. However, the Four Symbols Spirit Pill was even harder to concoct, and the ingredients needed were more precious, making the pill’s power superior.Yang Xiaotian recalled the guards at Yang Family Manor saying that Hu Lie had killed an Alchemist before. Could it be that these insight on Alchemy and the two Four Symbols Spirit Pills were acquired by Hu Lie from that Alchemist?Having been relentlessly pursued, Hu Lie presumably hadn’t had the chance to consume them; now, they conveniently benefited Yang Xiaotian.Yang Xiaotian took everything in the bundle, not leaving behind the gold. With this gold, he would be able to buy many things in the future.Only a fool would refuse.Not long after Yang Xiaotian left, Yang Chao, who was patrolling the nearby area with the guards of Yang Family Manor, came by, and they were all astonished to see Hu Lie’s corpse.They had all seen Hu Lie’s portrait and recognized that the person killed was indeed the notorious criminal, Hu Lie.“Such a powerful sword technique, killed with a single strike. Who could have killed Hu Lie?” one of the Yang Family Manor guards marveled with curiosity.“To have killed Hu Lie, the person must be at least a third-level Innate expert,” Yang Chao speculated, “And undoubtedly a master swordsman.”At that moment, Yang Hai also arrived with his guards, and upon seeing the slain Hu Lie, he was surprised yet secretly delighted. After all, the Imperial Court had put a bounty on Hu Lie’s head worth three thousand gold pieces.With this thought, he rushed to sever Hu Lie’s head with his sword.Just as Yang Hai was about to take the head away, Sun Hua, a guard following Yang Chao, mustered the courage to say, “Great Manor Lord, Yang Chao was the first to discover Hu Lie. Wouldn’t it be inappropriate for you to take the head?”Logically, even if the reward was to be claimed, it should have been Yang Chao.Upon hearing this, Yang Hai abruptly slapped Sun Hua across the face, shouting, “Are you blind? Who said he found him first? It was clearly me who discovered him first.”Prev ChapterNext ChapterReport

Invincible Divine SwordChapter 10 - 10 You and Your Son Are Just AlikePrev ChapterNext Chapter10 Chapter 10 You and Your Son Are Just AlikeTranslator: 549690339Sun Hua took a few steps back from the slap, a clear imprint of five fingers on his face.Yang Chao’s expression darkened. Sun Hua was his loyal subordinate, and not only had Yang Hai stolen Hu Lie’s credit to claim the reward, but he also took the opportunity to deliberately hurt his man.“Big brother, you’ve gone too far!” Yang Chao said in barely suppressed anger.“Gone too far?” Yang Hai glanced at Yang Chao and said, “What, you want to fight for your subordinate? Yang Chao, don’t blame your elder brother for not reminding you, accidents happen in a fight!”Upon hearing this, Yang Chao grew furious and said, “Fine, then let me experience your superior moves!” With that, he assumed a fighting stance.Seeing this, Yang Hai snorted coldly, set down Hu Lie’s head, and without another word, he slid forward, closing the gap, and hurled a punch towards Yang Chao’s chest.This punch was the Yang Family Manor’s Fierce Tiger Killing Fist, and it was the strongest move of the technique.Yang Chao, in response, circulated his Innate Qi and also threw a punch upwards.Boom! Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐mTheir fists collided with each other.Yang Chao was knocked back several steps from the impact.Although both were at the fourth level of Innate, Yang Chao had just entered this level, while Yang Hai had long been in the late stages of the fourth level of Innate. In terms of True Yuan, Yang Hai had a clear advantage over Yang Chao.Yang Hai sneered and rushed forward again, his fists attacking Yang Chao relentlessly, giving him no chance to catch his breath.Under the continuous fierce attacks from Yang Hai, after more than a dozen moves, Yang Chao was driven to desperate straits.Just then, Yang Ming arrived with a large group of guards from a distance, and shouted, “Stop!”“Father,” Yang Hai hurriedly approached Yang Ming and said, “I discovered Hu Lie first. My second brother wanted to snatch Hu Lie’s head. He struck at me, and I had no choice but to fight back.”Yang Ming glanced at Hu Lie’s head in the distance and nodded.Yang Chao stepped forward to explain, “Father, I discovered Hu Lie’s body first. It was the big brother who…”“Silence!” Yang Ming didn’t wait to hear the rest and rebuked, “Dare to quibble? For a mere Hu Lie’s head, you turned on your brother. You and your son are just the same.”It was clear that Yang Ming still remembered how Yang Xiaotian had hurt his beloved grandson, Yang Zhong, at the family’s annual competition.“Go back and reflect on where you went wrong!” Yang Ming coldly huffed at Yang Chao and then left with Yang Hai and the guards.Yang Chao stood still, watching his father Yang Ming’s retreating figure, his expression grim.“Second Manor Lord, are you alright?” a few Yang Family Manor guards came up to Sun Hua and asked with concern.Yang Chao looked at them, feeling a warmth in his heart, and shook his head: “I’m fine.”Sun Hua said indignantly, “It was clearly the Great Manor Lord who stole the Second Manor Lord’s reward. Not only did the Manor Lord not listen to your explanation, Second Manor Lord, but he also scolded you.”“The Manor Lord is too biased towards the Great Manor Lord.”Yang Chao looked up with a sigh and fell silent.Since his Martial Soul was not as good as his big brother’s, his father had favored his older brother since childhood. Now with Yang Zhong awakening a top-tier level 10 Martial Soul, his father’s favoritism towards his big brother and Yang Zhong grew even stronger.“Let’s head back too.” Yang Chao’s voice was somewhat dejected.Meanwhile, Yang Xiaotian had arrived at the mountain valley cave abode and sat down on the Cold Jade Bed, swallowing a Four Symbols Spirit Pill.Immediately, the strength of the Spirit Pill turned into rolling waves of heat.Yang Xiaotian quickly began to practice the Primordial Dragon Art.The force of the Spirit Pill was continuously converted into Fighting Spirit within Yang Xiaotian’s body.As the Fighting Spirit in his body grew stronger and stronger, suddenly, there was a booming sound inside Yang Xiaotian. The barrier of Innate was finally broken through.At this moment, all the Fighting Spirit in his meridians converged at the Dantian, swirling and condensing into a massive cyclone.Several hours later, Yang Xiaotian stopped.Peering into his Dantian at the large cyclone, his face lit up with joy.After breaking through from the Acquired realm to the Innate realm, a cyclone would form in the Dantian.This meant that he had indeed successfully stepped into the realm of the Innate.Once one steps into the Innate, in the Martial Soul World, one’s status is completely transformed, with a sky-high difference between Innate and Acquired realms.In places like Yang Family Manor, Acquired masters could only serve as guards, whereas an Innate Grandmaster would be an esteemed guest.In the entire Yang Family Manor, there were only seven Innate Grandmasters.However, the cyclone in his own Dantian was somewhat large; typically, an Innate Grandmaster’s cyclone would only be the size of a fist, but his was several meters across.But the larger the cyclone, the more profound the True Qi.This was a great thing.Yang Xiaotian emerged from his cave dwelling and came to an open space in the valley, holding the Heaven-Penetrating Divine Sword and again performing the first move of the Heaven-Penetrating Sword Technique.“One Sword Yin Yang!”Instantly, a stream of Sword Qi shot from the tip of the sword, and then the Sword Qi suddenly split in two, swiftly penetrating the mountain wall in the distance, creating two startling sword holes tens of meters apart on the wall.Previously, when he was still in the Acquired realm, Yang Xiaotian could unleash only one stream of Sword Qi with this move, unable to split it into two, so he could not bring out the true power of the technique.Now, having entered the Innate realm, he could finally unleash the full power of this move.Afterward, Yang Xiaotian took out the Heaven-Penetrating Secret Manual and flipped to the second move; now that he had entered the Innate realm, he could practice it.Soon, Yang Xiaotian memorized the second move in his mind. However, he was not in a rush to practice. Instead, he mentally rehearsed it before executing the move with his sword.He practiced the sword technique for a while, and as the sky began to brighten, Yang Xiaotian hurried back to Yang Family Manor.Upon returning to Yang Family Manor, he did not sleep but took out Hu Lie’s Soul Severing Blade Technique to study.According to the book, the Soul Severing Blade Technique was an Innate martial arts technique from the Soul Severing Sect of the neighboring Tiandou Imperial Kingdom.Yang Xiaotian quickly went through the Soul Severing Blade Technique and then, using a tree branch as a substitute for a blade, practiced in the courtyard; the Soul Severing Blade Technique consisted of sixty-four moves, and Yang Xiaotian practiced from the first move to the last.“Innate martial arts don’t seem that hard to cultivate,” Yang Xiaotian thought to himself.His father had said that it often took months of hard work to fully learn an Innate technique.But he had learned it all with just one reading.Just then, his sister Yang Ling’er walked in, her face puffed up with anger.Yang Xiaotian was curious and asked, “Little sister, what’s wrong?”With Yang Zhong not around, there shouldn’t be any kids bullying her at Yang Family Manor.“It’s our uncle; he took father’s bounty,” Yang Ling’er said furiously, then explained how Yang Hai had claimed the bounty for Hu Lie’s head.Of course, she too had heard it from a few guards of Yang Family Manor.Yang Ling’er angrily said, “Father mentioned that with those three thousand gold coins, he could have bought you three portions of Foundation Building Spiritual Liquid, and then you could have broken through to the second tier.”Upon hearing this, Yang Xiaotian laughed. So this was what really bothered the little girl.Feeling warmth in his heart, he touched his cute sister’s face and said with a smile, “Don’t worry, even without those three portions of Foundation Building Spiritual Liquid, your big brother will break through to the second tier very soon.”Prev ChapterNext ChapterReport
